# Title: Fashion Expansion

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose:
I wanted to advocate for better representation, diversity, equity, & inclusion in the fashion industry. For a large majority of the world, it is rare to see people who look like them in fashion magazines, store catalogs, & brand advertisements. There are also lots of stores that don’t carry clothes for certain sizes with "one size fits all" clothing. This can lower self-esteems by creating an unfair beauty standard, which can make people feel like there's something wrong with them. No matter a person’s size, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identification, or more: everyone must be represented in the fashion industry.

## Project Description:
Fashion Expansion is a website with 4 pages that all serve different purposes. The Home page provides a quick description of what Fashion Expansion's goal is and videos that teach you more about representation, diversity, equity, & inclusion. The About page goes into further detail about the problem Fashion Expansion is trying to highlight, and displays Fashion Expansion's Mission Statement and Purpose. Next is the Positivity page, which generates positive affirmations every time you click a button. The last page is Take Action, which shows you how you can make a difference. The first way is by advocating  on social media, and the website links you to Twitter and Instagram. The second way is by emailing a Fashion brand that might not be taking the proper steps for representation, diversity, equity, & inclusion. Fashion Expansion provides you with a personalized email template based on the information you input.

### Pages on the site:
1. Home
2. About
3. Positivity
4. Take Action

### Key Features:
1. Positive Affirmation Generator
2. Personalized Email Template Generator

## Challenges:
This was one of my first times using JavaScript in a personal project, and this did bode some challenges for me. It took me a while to debug my "Personalized Email Template Generator," but I eventually figured it out!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## In the Future:
I would like to add a new feature that generates personalized templates for posts on Instagram and Twitter! I hope to add this feature sometime soon.
